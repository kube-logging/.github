# Welcome to Kube Logging!

Hello and welcome to Kube Logging!
We are the proud maintainers of the [Logging Operator](https://github.com/kube-logging/logging-operator), a powerful open-source project dedicated to simplifying the complex world of logging on Kubernetes.

Our main focus is to make logging on Kubernetes an accessible, understandable, and straightforward process for everyone, regardless of their skill level or experience.
We believe in the power of community-driven development, and we are constantly inspired by the ways in which our community innovates and shapes the future of the Logging Operator.
